# LoginAndRegistrationFinal
This project uses Spring boot and Spring security to allow users to login and register and stores user information in a mysql database. 
All passwords stored in the database are encrypted and users are provided roles for either user or admin. 
All web pages where designed by me in HTML and CSS for styling. 
I used Thymeleaf used for templating web pages and providing form field validations.


***Java Version 8 or above***
***Html5 and Css3***


## Installation

I use spring tool suite to run this application but it will work with any java spring boot environment. 

1. Import the project into spring tool suite with java ee enabled.
2. Make sure all dependencies and starter poms are imported in the "pom.xml" file.
3. Create the mysql database with the name as "loginandreg". 
4. Make sure the username for the database is set to "username" and password as "password".
4. Right click on the project and select run as spring boot project.
5. Go to your default browser and search for "http://localhost:8080/createAccount" to create your first account.
